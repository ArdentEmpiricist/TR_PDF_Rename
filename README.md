Solves a niche problem, but may be useful to some.

The neo-broker Trade Republic does not name security transaction statements in a reasonable way. So TR_PDF_Rename helps to archive the documents and renames all PDF files with the pattern date_transactiontype_stockname. 

Warning: Should only be used on PDF files from Trade Republic or directories only containing these files! Will panic if used with non Trade Republic PDF files.
